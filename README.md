# Internship Tasks - Rima Poddar

Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting the tasks and projects I completed during my one-month internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. This repository includes code, documentation, and reports related to my internship activities.


## Tasks

### Task 1: Voice Assistant

## Functionality:
1.Speech Recognition: Captures and processes voice commands using the SpeechRecognition library.

2.Text-to-Speech: Provides spoken responses using the pyttsx3 library.

3.Basic Commands:
Greetings: Responds to "hello".
Time and Date: Tells the current time and date.
Wikipedia Search: Fetches and reads a summary from Wikipedia for specified queries.

**Outcome:**  
This project provided me with practical experience in working with speech recognition and natural language processing technologies, enhancing my skills in building interactive voice-based applications. 

### Task 2: BMI Calculator

## Functionality:
1.User Input Validation: Utilized a while loop and exception handling to ensure valid numeric input for weight and height.

2.BMI Calculation: Developed a function to calculate BMI based on weight and height inputs.

3.BMI Categorization: Implemented logic to categorize BMI into different weight categories: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obesity.

4.Informative Output: Provided clear feedback to the user by displaying calculated BMI and its corresponding weight category.

**Outcome:**  
This project has significantly improved my Python programming skills, especially in areas such as input validation, mathematical calculations, and conditional logic. It also enhanced my ability to deliver clear and user-friendly feedback, which is crucial for creating intuitive applications. The project serves as a valuable learning experience and a solid foundation for tackling more complex programming challenges in the future.

### Task 3: Simple Password generator

## Functionalities:

1.Customizable Character Sets: Users can choose to include or exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation marks in their passwords.

2.Random Shuffling: The script ensures that the generated password is shuffled randomly, enhancing security.

3.Error Handling: The script includes robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and ensure that at least one character set is selected.

**Outcome:**
With this script, you can easily create strong and unpredictable passwords tailored to your specific needs. Whether you need a complex password for a high-security application or a simple one for a less critical use, this script has got you covered.
